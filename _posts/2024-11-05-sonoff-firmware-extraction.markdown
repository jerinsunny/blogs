In todayâ€™s interconnected world, smart home devices have become ubiquitous, but they also introduce unique security challenges. In this blog we explore the vulnerabilities identified during our security research on `Sonoff Smart Home IoT devices`, which earned CVE-2024-7205 and CVE-2024-7206.

The blog covers the basics of the target device, and discusses the methodology used for assessing its security posture, overcoming integrity checks to successfully boot modified firmware and finally performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.

The main objective of this security research was to uncover vulnerabilities in Sonoff Smart Home IoT devices, specifically targeting the hardware and firmware.

# Target Description

Sonoff has a wide range of smart home products, including smart switches, lights, gateways, sensors, etc.. The aim of our security research was to uncover vulnerabilities in Sonoff Wifi Devices. The target device selected for this security research was the **[Sonoff ZigBee Bridge (ZB Bridge)](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/zbbridge/)** - one of the Sonoff Wifi devices. The Sonoff ZigBee Bridge connects to various sensors over ZigBee, accumulates the data and sends it to the cloud. The eWelink app is used to interact with the devices and access data over the cloud. 
The **[eWelink App]()** is used to pair the device over Bluetooth. The app provides other features, such as device sharing with a secondary user, where the secondary user can also interact with the device. `The paid version allows the primary user to restrict access to the secondary user.`

    Target Product Versions:
        Ewelink App version - 5.3.0
        Firmware Version    - 1.3.0


# Target Reconnaissance

As part of the initial recon, to gain more information about the hardware, we began with a physical teardown.
Opening the device gave us our first look at its internal hardware, and allowed us to analyse the PCB and its components. 

<!-- <figure style="text-align:center;">

The CC-based MCU is used for ZigBee communication, while the EPS32 based MCU serves as the brain of the device, managing all other smart home functionalities and the Wifi connectivity. 


# Firmware Extraction

Analyzing the firmware of an IoT device is a crucial step in security research, as it can reveal potential vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, and APIs that could be exploited. There are several methods to extract firmware such as Memory Chip Extraction, Firmware Update File, Debug Port etc.

## Debug port analysis

We decided to investigate the debug port on the target device to determine if the firmware could be extracted through it. Analyzing the PCB markings, it appeared to be a UART debug port. On connecting it with a USB to serial converter we get boot logs as shown in the figure below

<!-- <figure style="text-align:center;">

        <figcaption style="margin-top: auto;">Boot Logs</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

### Boot Mode

On referring to the [ESP32 Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf), we understand that the the chip allows configuring its boot parameters through Strapping pins, GPIO0 is one of the strapping pins which controls the boot mode. This pin is also present on the debug port. Using this pin, we switched the boot mode and got access to the download boot mode.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/download_boot_mode.webp" width="70%" > 
<figcaption>ESP32 Download Boot Mode 
 </figcaption>
</figure>


Once the device is in download boot mode, we can utilize [Esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/esptool/index.html), a Python-based utility, to communicate with the device. `Esptool` allows us to interact with the ROM bootloader in Espressif SoCs, providing various capabilities such as:

    * Reading, writing, erasing, and verifying binary data stored in the flash memory.
    * Retrieving chip features and other related data, including the MAC address or flash chip ID.
    * Preparing binary executable images ready for flashing.

# Firmware Analysis
### ESP32 Partition Table
To extract the full flash contents, we can use Esptool. However, let's dive deep down into how external flash memory is mapped and used in  most of the Espressif SoCs. A single ESP32's flash can contain multiple apps, as well as many different kinds of data (calibration data, filesystems, parameter storage, etc). For this reason a Partition Table is maintained within the flash.

We first extracted the partition table from the target device. The partition table then can be analysed using [gen_esp32part.py](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/46acfdce/components/partition_table/gen_esp32part.py)

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/partition_table.webp" width="70%" > 
<figcaption>Partition Table 
 </figcaption>
</figure>

The partition table entries include a name (label), type (app, data, or something else), subtype and the offset where the partition is loaded, as shown in figure above. The type field indicates the data type stored in each partition. 

Each of these partitions can be extracted separately and analyzed individually.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/nvs.webp" width="70%" >

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/strings_cert.webp" width="80%" > 
<figcaption>Certificates within the Sonoff Device Firmware. 
 </figcaption>
</figure>


Our analysis of these partitions revealed the following:
```
* The Application firmware is stored in in ota_0 and ota_1 partition. It also contains certificates for authenticating cloud communication.
* The NVS partition contains the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi APs.
* The Version partition contains the version information.
* The Otadata, phy_init have other supporting data required for the device to function.
```

# Firmware Modification

<!-- Now that we have successfully extracted the firmware, it's time to dive into the analysis.  -->

The partition of interest is the application firmware i.e ota_0 and ota_1 , which contains the core app code specific to this smart home device. This is where we expect to find the logic that controls the device's features, communication protocols, and potentially, any hardcoded credentials or configurations.


However, before we start dissecting the application firmware, it is crucial to determine whether we can modify the firmware and flash it back to the device. This step helps us verify if the device employs any firmware integrity checks, such as digital signatures or checksums, which are designed to prevent unauthorized firmware modifications.

## Secure boot

Espressif SoCs feature a Secure Boot mechanism designed to ensure that only trusted firmware is executed on the device. These SoCs utilize eFuses to store system parameters and enable various security features. The ESP32 Technical Reference Manual provides details on the eFuses and the specific fuses responsible for each feature. We use the `espefuse.py` tool to inspect the device's eFuse settings.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/secure_boot.webp" width="90%" > 
<figcaption>ESP32 Secure Boot eFuse Values 
 </figcaption>
</figure>
 
The secure boot feature was found to be disabled on the target device as shown in the figure above.

We modified the  application firmware by making a small controlled change and flashing it back to the target device. However, after flashing the modified firmware, the device failed to boot.

### ESP32 Application Image Format

ESP32 has a application image format that includes a footer with a single byte checksum and SHA256 hash. ESP32 uses this checksum and hash to verify the application partition.  We can use esptool to check if the checksum and hash is valid for the modified file.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/mod_invalid.webp" width="90%" >
<figcaption>Checksum and hash for modified App Image
 </figcaption>
</figure>


Unless the checksum and hash is valid, the bootloader will panic on startup, and fail to run the modified app partition . Since secure boot is not enabled, this checksum and hash do not provide a strong security guarantee. So we can locate the checksum and hash and modify it.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/mod_valid.webp" width="90%" >
<figcaption>Replaced checksum and has for modified App Image
 </figcaption>
</figure>

Once the checksum and hash are replaced with valid values, we can flash the modified firmware back to the target device using esptool. This allowed us to successfully boot the modified firmware on the device. 

{% include admonition.html type="warning" title="Vulnerability" body="CWE-1326: Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware" %}

* * *
As explained above, Sonoff IoT devices communicate with the cloud to transfer device telemetry and perform various smart operations. Now that we have extracted and successfully boot the modified firmware, we can focus on analysing and manipulating the communication between the device and the cloud.

For this purpose, we need to identify all the API endpoints the IoT device connects to and find any security tokens or keys used for device authentication with the cloud. This will allow us to clone the device as well as asses the security posture of this communication.  There are two approaches to accomplish our goals. The first method is to reverse engineer the entire firmware we extracted. The second method is to perform a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) intercepting the device's communication with the cloud and inspect the online traffic that goes in and out of it.   We opted for the second approach because if successful, it would provide a more complete understanding of the real time communication between the device and the cloud.

# MITM Attack 

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/mitm.png" width="50%" >
<figcaption>MITM Attack
 </figcaption>
</figure>


In Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on the communication, steal sensitive information, or inject malicious data.

### Cloud Communication Analysis

Using wireshark we can analyze the WiFi Traffic. Using the deviceâ€™s assigned IP, we can filter out the traffic particular to the device.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/initial_tls.webp" width="100%" > 
<figcaption>Capturing Sonoff device traffic. 
 </figcaption>
</figure>

As shown in above wireshark log, the device first sends a DNS query to resolve the IP address for the domain name as-dispd.coolki.cc. After the IP is resolved the device uses this IP address to connect to the web server. Â After that the device initiates a TLS/SSL connection to the web server.

{% include admonition.html type="info" title="TLS/SSL" body="TLS/SSL communication ensures secure data transmission by encrypting the data and verifying the identity of the communicating parties." %}

Since the device uses TLS communication, unless there is a flaw in the TLS protocol implementation, the device communication to and from the cloud is encrypted and unreadable. To decrypt the communication, we need to set up a a MITM proxy server and route the device's traffic through it.

### Using Burp Suite as a Proxy  

Assuming that our device uses HTTP to communicate, we use Burp Suite as the proxy to handle the device traffic. Burp Proxy can be used as web proxy to intercept, inspect, and modify traffic that passes in both directions. For Burp Suite to successfully intercept/decrypt the device traffic , we need to install Burp CA certificate on device. 

### Replacing CA certificate on device

As mentioned above, we had extracted the firmware of the device. Our analysis of the firmware revealed that there are certificates embedded within ota_0 and ota_1 partitions.

Next, we extracted the certificate from the firmware and analyzed it. The extracted certificate appears to be a Root CA certificate, used by the device to authenticate the cloud communication. For Burpsuite to successfully intercept the cloud communication we need to add Burp's CA certificate in the firmware and then flash the modified firmware back to the device, following the steps described above.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/sonoff_root_ca.webp" width="30%" >
    <figcaption>Root CA within Device Firmware.</figcaption>
</figure>


# Achieving Successful MITM Interception

With all the prerequisites in place, we are now able to successfully perform the MITM attack and intercept the traffic between the IoT device and the cloud server. The Burp Suite proxy is able to intercept and forward all traffic from the IoT device to the cloud server, as well as forward the server's response back to the device.


<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/burp_data.webp" width="100%" > 
<figcaption>Successfully Proxying device data through Burpsuite.</figcaption>
</figure>



Now that we have the capability to monitor the traffic, we can begin analyzing the communication. It was observed that the device primarily utilizes websockets to transmit sensor data and receive data from the cloud server. We were able to identify various API endpoints and JSON payloads that the device uses to communicate with the cloud.
Analyzing the intercepted traffic, we can see the actual payload data transmitted from the device to the cloud server, including sensor data and other information.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/ds_1.webp" width="55%" > 
<figcaption>Device using websockets to transmit sensor data to cloud.</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-end;">
    <figure style="width: 51%; text-align: center;">
        <img src="../../../assets/sonoff/images/ds_2.webp" width="100%">
        <figcaption style="margin-top: auto;">JSON Payload for Door Sensor.</figcaption>

        <figcaption style="margin-top: auto;">JSON Payload for Temperature Sensor.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>


Now that we have identified the payload data, we can modify it and send false data to the cloud server.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-end;">
    <figure style="width: 45%; text-align: center;">

        <figcaption style="margin-top: auto;">Sending manipulated data using Burpsuite</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

## Cloning the device
Now we further analyzed the communication for authentication information such as authentication tokens or device keys, which the device uses to authenticate itself to the cloud. We found that the important parameters used to identify and authenticate the device were - device ID , chip id and the device key. With the parameters obtained , we can now perform authenticated requests to the cloud server as the device and act as the IoT Device remotely.

<video class="center" width="80%" autoplay loop muted >
  <source src="../../../assets/sonoff/gifs/clone.webm" type="video/webm"/>
</video>

We also observed that the cloud server does not check whether the device is already connected. Once the attacker obtains these parameters, they can connect to the cloud server and impersonate the device. In such cases, the cloud server drops the existing connection.

We also found that these authentication parameters were exposed by the device and mobile app through various other means, such as unsecured phone logs and Bluetooth pairing information. An attacker with knowledge of the API endpoints and payloads could control the device without necessarily extracting the firmware.
